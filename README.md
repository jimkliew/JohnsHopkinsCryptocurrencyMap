Purpose: Aggregating and synthesizing fundamental data on digital currencies and the underlying Blockchain technology to address the lack of transparency and usability of data that promotes their usability and supports initiatives. 

Our project entails a systematic and fully transparent approach to gathering data, munging data, and making fundamental data easily accessible to everyone - academic researchers, regulators, and industry - upon which future multidisciplinary studies can be undertaken.
